# Paycheck to Paycheck

Paycheck to Paycheck is an open-source web application designed to help individuals manage their bills efficiently. The
application allows users to track bill payments, due dates, auto-pay statuses, and other relevant details in an
organized way. You can also share bills with others, edit them directly from the table, and manage user access roles
such as Viewer or Editor.

## Features

- **Bill Management**: Easily manage bills, due dates, amounts, and payment statuses in one place.
- **Real-Time Editing**: Click any table cell to edit it, and the data is saved upon blur.
- **Sorting & Filtering**: Sort bills by any column (e.g., due date, amount, etc.) and toggle between ascending, descending, or neutral states.
- **Disable Bills**: Move bills between active and disabled states.
- **Share Documents**: Share bills with others by adding them as viewers or editors.
- **Document Management**: Each bill is part of a document, which can be managed, shared, or deleted.
